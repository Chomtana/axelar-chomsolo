## Future vision/roadmap for your dApp

Axelar Domains is 60% production ready. I plan to partnership with multiple entities such as Axelar, Flipside, AxelarSea and projects in Axelar grant before launching. Domain itself is worthless but with many partnerships and use cases it will become a diamond. If we put 20% burning rate on domain registration, we can burn $1M of Axelar tokens per year assuming there are 500,000 active domains. Currently, there aren't any competitor on cross-chain domain space. This is a huge opportunity. Reach out to me in case you want to partnership and want this product to go on production.

## Functionality concerns

Domain renews functionality is disabled as of now. Although it can renew on a single chain, syncing the renew to other chains is currently in design. Many components are well-designed but not shown in the video due to time limit. Reach out to me if you want to learn more.
